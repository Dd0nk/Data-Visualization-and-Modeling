I'd recommend starting on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Read through all of the material about the dataset and download a .CSV file.\n\n1. Write a short summary of the data.  Where did it come from?  How was it collected?  What are the features in the data?  Why is this dataset interesting to you?  \n\n2. Identify 5 interesting questions about your data that you can answer using Pandas methods.  \n\n3. Answer those questions!  You may use any method you want (including LLMs) to help you write your code; however, you should use Pandas to find the answers.  LLMs will not always write code in this way without specific instruction.  \n\n4. Write the answer to your question in a text box underneath the code you used to calculate the answer.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"74da66be-dbfc-4140-93c4-b600e98f6df2","cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. The dataset that I will be reporting on is collected crime data from Indian states and union territories. The dataset accounts for three years of crime data in which an arrest was made without need for a proper warrent (I.e.- crimes that were obviously and deliberatly illegal), from 2020-2022. This was collected by the Indian government and was shared from their public .gov website. The dataset holds information by the amount of crimes that were reported, the region in which these crimes were reported, all defined within three annual chunks of data. The reason that this dataset interests me has to do with the fact that I am deeply fascinated over true-crime and law. I hope to use my computer science degree to one day become a digital forensics analyist.\n2. (1). Which State/ UT had the most reported crimes for any given year? (2). Which State / UT had the least? (3). Do the States or the UT's have more reported crimes per year on average? (4). Which State / UT is the statistical 'safest' overall? (5).
